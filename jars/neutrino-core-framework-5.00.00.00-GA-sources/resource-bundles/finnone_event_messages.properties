#Please use exclamation mark (!) while using any model property for free-marker template.
#It is used to handle   null and non-existent(missing) properties.(No exception will be raised)
#For example, both if x is null in the data-model and if it's not present at all, ${x!'missing'}
#will print ``missing''.So  ${x!} will print nothing(empty string).
#So always use ${PROPERTY_NAME!} instead of ${PROPERTY_NAME}

#NOTE:Some properties like ${ASSOCIATED_USER!}(user who is responsible for event),${EVENT_TIMESTAMP!}
#(event date and time in user preferred format) are always available irrespective of event types
